# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

# Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Once a Pull Request has been discussed and items discussed have been implemented/changed, an admin may approve and merge the Pull    Request into the target branch.

## Standards

* Ensure that code contributed adheres to coding standards already visible in the codebase. 
 * An admin will ensure that code contributed follows these standards, and will comment on them in Pull requests if not followed - delaying code adjustments/contributions.

* Ensure that Pull Requests are targeted to merge back into the `development` branch. Ideally, any changes you are making should be made on feature branches too unless discussed previously or are of small nature.

### Branch Standards

Development should occur in feature or bug branches, branched from the latest commit on the `development` branch and kept up to date with the `development` branch as often as possible. 

`Master` is a protected branch, designed to only be merged into from `development` when a stable build is produced and tagged on the `development` branch. This build should then be added to the [Repositorys releases](https://github.com/KieranBond/PReticulated/releases).

Branch names should be structured as so: `type/#relatedIssueNumber-feature-or-bug-name`.

Examples:
 * feature/#100-ui-update
 * bug/#90-conversion-failure

### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
